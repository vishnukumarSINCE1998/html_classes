        can't come up with a refreshing plot. It looks like the director hasn't really come out of his Tholi Prema
        hangover as he dishes out yet another one-sided love saga but fails to come up with a valid and logical reason
        to make a Gen Z lad to hold back his feelings for his lover until the last moment. However, he compensates it
        all, by adding loads of fun moments in the film and the screenplay does have its share of some touching
        moments."[21] In 2011, he appeared in Mr. Perfect, another romantic comedy. The review site GreatAndhra rated
        the film with three stars and noted "The film comes across as a clean, family entertainer and the intention of
        the makers must be appreciated.</p>
